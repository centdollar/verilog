# verilog
a repo with all of my custom verilog code in it


# Structure
Each folder is its own file with all dependencies and test benches that are needed to test the module

The Code is attempted to be as parameterized as possible in order for the code to be reused in multiple cases.


# TODO
Get GTKwave and iverilog working for test benches so i can compile and simulate form here without the overhead of quartus.  
Write a buffered uart module with the fifo and uart module.  
--> add some cool functionality to it
